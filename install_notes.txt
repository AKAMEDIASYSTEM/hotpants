LOUIE -> VCNL4000
HUEY  -> TMP102
DEWEY-> photocell

HOW TO EDIT HOTPANTS SCRIPTS
connect ethernet to board (NOTE, board is screwed into box - it doesn't come out)
ssh root@[name_on_sticker].local
password: just press enter
cd hotpants
ok, from here you can directly edit the files.
LOUIE -> hotpants-VCNL4000.py
HUEY  -> hotpants-TMP102.py
DEWEY-> hotpants-photocell.py
After making changes, you must reboot the device in order to have them take effect

LIVE DEBUGGING
...if you are going to be printing synchronous debug info (to see realtime sensor values) to the console, it is easier to turn off the auto-run services first.
ssh into the board you want to debug
turn off the auto-run features of the system with these lines:
systemctl stop hotpants.timer
systemctl stop hotpants.service
systemctl disable hotpants.timer
systemctl disable hotpants.service (don't worry if this line throws an error)
...now the scripts will never run unless invoked, ie python hotpants-photocell.py
now do whatever adjustments you like.
to restore the auto-run scripts, do this:
systemctl enable hotpants.timer
reboot
 

SENSITIVITY
near the bottom of each script is the variable "emission_threshold"
that's what you should change to make the sensor more or less sensitive
before changing it, it might be helpful to uncomment the "print(r)" line at the beginning of the function checkSensor()
uncommenting that line will give you realtime output from the sensor

HOW TO SEE THE PAST FEW PRINT STATEMENTS
systemctl status hotpants.service -n 10
(change the 10 to however many lines of debug output you'd like to see)

FIRST DEBUG STEP should probably be to unplug it and plug it back in

PRINTING PROBLEMS?
 - feeding poorly
 	if the printer is printing over itself and not advancing properly, you may need to pull the paper for awhile (about a foot) to get it started.
 	if problems persist, the paper roll is probably smashed; swap in a new roll
 - replacing paper rolls
 	the paper goes "underhand" and comes up to meet the print head. It's not damaging to install it backwards; you'll know it's backwards if it advances properly and doesn't print anything
 - if despite all efforts the printer isn't printing, make sure the power supply is the correct one: there is only one 12v power supply (marked with pink tape) and it goes with the printer that does *not* have a little transparent window; it has what looks like white duct tape instead



HOW TO SWAP OUT A BEAGLEBONE
	when in SPARE_BBB (named "bender"), do:
		ssh root@bender.local
		(no password - just press enter)
		nano /lib/systemd/system/hotpants.service
		change the line "ExecStart=" to point to the script you need;
		the script will be hotpants-TMP102.py (mug), hotpants-VCNL4000.py (blocks), or hotpants-photocell.py (apple)
		save the file (ctrl-x, then "y" to save, then enter to overwrite the file)
		now in terminal type "systemctl enable hotpants.timer"
		then type "reboot"
		system should start up and print "i am awake and i am [sesor_type]"

HOW TO EDIT HOTPANTS SCRIPTS
connect ethernet to board (NOTE, board is screwed into box - it doesn't come out)
ssh root@[name_on_sticker].local
password: just press enter
cd hotpants
ok, from here you can directly edit the files.
LOUIE -> hotpants-VCNL4000.py
HUEY  -> hotpants-TMP102.py
DEWEY-> hotpants-photocell.py
After making changes, you must reboot the device in order to have them take effect

HOW TO SEE THE PAST FEW PRINT STATEMENTS
systemctl status hotpants.service -n 10
(change the 10 to however many lines of debug output you'd like to see)

FIRST DEBUG STEP should probably be to unplug it and plug it back in

PRINTING PROBLEMS?
 - feeding poorly
 	if the printer is printing over itself and not advancing properly, you may need to pull the paper for awhile (about a foot) to get it started.
 	if problems persist, the paper roll is probably smashed; swap in a new roll
 - replacing paper rolls
 	the paper goes "underhand" and comes up to meet the print head. It's not damaging to install it backwards; you'll know it's backwards if it advances properly and doesn't print anything
 - if despite all efforts the printer isn't printing, make sure the power supply is the correct one: there is only one 12v power supply (marked with pink tape) and it goes with the printer that does *not* have a little transparent window; it has what looks like white duct tape instead

 

HOW TO SWAP OUT A BEAGLEBONE
	when in SPARE_BBB (named "bender"), do:
		ssh root@bender.local
		(no password - just press enter)
		nano /lib/systemd/system/hotpants.service
		change the line "ExecStart=" to point to the script you need;
		the script will be hotpants-TMP102.py (mug), hotpants-VCNL4000.py (blocks), or hotpants-photocell.py (apple)
		save the file (ctrl-x, then "y" to save, then enter to overwrite the file)
		now in terminal type "systemctl enable hotpants.timer"
		then type "reboot"
		system should start up and print "i am awake and i am [sesor_type]"

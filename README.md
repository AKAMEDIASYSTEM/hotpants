HOT_PANTS
======================
A Beaglebone Black sensor installation for the Future of Storytelling conference in NYC in October 2013.

See [an upcoming blogpost at blog.nytlabs.com] for more background info.

(FWIW, the project is codenamed hotpants simply because that is the first object/sensor output combination I could think of.)
